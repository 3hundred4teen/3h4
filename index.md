## About Me
I'm 16, from the UK, and currently studying Maths and Further Maths, Physics, and Music at A-Level, with hopes to read Physics at Cambridge. I've been interested in maker/hacker and Raspberry Pi stuff since the first Raspberry Pi came out almost 6 years ago! Here I post about projects, interests, or general stuff
